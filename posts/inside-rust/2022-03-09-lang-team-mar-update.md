Two weeks ago, the lang team held its March planning meeting ([minutes]). We hold these meetings on the first Wednesday of every month and we use them to schedule [design meetings] for the remainder of the month.

## Upcoming design meetings

We have planned the following design meetings:

* March 9: Draft lang team roadmap (this already happened! [minutes](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/design-meeting-minutes/2022-03-09-lang-roadmap.md))
* March 16: [Backlog bonanza](https://lang-team.rust-lang.org/meetings/backlog-bonanza.html)
* March 23: Return Position Impl Trait in Dyn Trait (RPITIDT) [lang-team#144](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/144)
* March 30: Lint policy [lang-team#132](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/132)

## Design meeting expectations

* The document for the meeting must be prepared by the triage meeting on Tuesday and posted to the tracking issue.
    * If it is not sent out by then, the meeting will be canceled. This gives folks 24 hour notice.
* There is no expectation that people will read the document before the meeting. The meeting will begin with a recap of the document.
    * However, there is no rule **against** reading the document beforehand and providing feedback or advice on how to improve it.
